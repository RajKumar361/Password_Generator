# Password_Generator
The Password Generator project is a Java-based utility that allows users (or other systems) to dynamically generate strong, random passwords. The codebase is modular, with components to define character sets, to construct the password, to test its strength, and to handle entry-point logic. 

Key goals of the project include:

Provide a clean, reusable Java library for password generation.

Encourage proper use of character sets (alphabets, numbers, symbols) in a balanced way.

Include unit testing to validate behaviour and maintain quality.

Offer a straightforward command-line or programmatic interface for integration.

This makes the project suitable for developers who need to generate passwords securely, learners practising Java fundamentals (e.g., classes, encapsulation, unit tests), and anyone wanting to embed password-generation logic into a larger system.
